The pink dragons, however, did not learn to share and were unable to gain the trust of the others.
Although they learned to come up with delicious combinations of herbs and food from their surroundings, no one was ever able to try them.
Their skill at combining flavors also manifested itself in the creation of potions. They could have healed others, but chose only themselves. The others did not want to support them either, so they distanced themselves from the pink family and chose to live separately.
