A blue dragon lived in frosty peace,
But hated noise that would not cease.
When voices rose both near and far,
His patience cracked like frozen glass.

With icy breath, fifteen times told,
He froze them stiff in silent cold.
No move, no sound — the lesson clear:
Respect the quiet of the blue dragon’s ear.
