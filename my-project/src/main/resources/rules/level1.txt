Then you're just in time. All the dragons are mixed up.
And you need to bring the families together.

    1. Pick a column to pick up the top dragon
    2. Pick another column if it matches or the column is empty.
    3. Only one dragon can be moved at a time.
    4. A column must have space for the dragon to be placed.
    5. Sort all dragon by sight to win!

Traitors are all around us but don't worry, here's a clue:
    A dark dragon flew so high,
    With fire burning in the sky.
    It roared, it fought, it made them run,
    Red dragon mixes up families just for fun.
